kernel.c - Kernel file, initializes the audio by calling initAudio during the boot process.

enumPci.c - Enumerates the PCI using the checkBuses funciton. To avoid general slowness there are lots of cutoff points
to move to the next bus. Generic and should work on any audio driver as it only checks the Class and Subclass fields for
final acceptance.

audio.c - Initializes the device to a state that is user ready. This is where playSound is an ideally would be able to
be called by a buffer and written to the CORB Ring.

userland - In the userland directory there is a function called sound.c to play the sound when a user presses X. This got
sidetracked and I was never got the chance to take the command out of kernel and entirely make it a user command.

beep.h - A generic Data buffer to see if I could get anything to play at all.

Not present - wav.c/wav.h this was going to be my wav buffer but never got a chance to implement in the mayhem of figuring 
out the rest of audio.
