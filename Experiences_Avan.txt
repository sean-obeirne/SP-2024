Taking on this task I definitely way underestimated the complexity of the task
as it actually was. Audio always has picked my interest for it is an
interesting way that the computer can reach and communicate with the real
world. In fact my first project was getting an arduino to play audio from 
pre-made files. Although that was far easier than this task. Enumerating
the PCI was extremely straightforward. Despite this I still managed to get
over eager about bit shifting. Hence the do not duplicate bitshift comment. I 
then immediately began to struggle with the audio. I attempted to follow along
with the CORBS ring method. This was a complete failure as I couldn't quite
determine why but even with my interrupt enabled the program would quite every
time that the command call was made.

Overall, I learned a tremendous amount and appreciated the difficulty of this
project and the fact that it challenged me in numerous ways.
