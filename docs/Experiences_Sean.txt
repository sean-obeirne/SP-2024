Experiences

I definitely had some interesting time this semester with this project. After
starting a little after Spring break, I started with designing the general 
filesystem structure and wrote some code to do some basic operations. One
notable experience with this project is that I had to sort of re-design my
module multiple times, and I tried to hack together the two designs but I didn't
really wind up being happy with how the logic was working. I think, if I could
do things over, I probably would have done some type of FS implementation in 
python first, just so I could have more quickly mock up and checked out some 
design decisions.
